# KitchenTimer
This is an Arduino Pro Mini timer.
It has 4 buttons:
-Reset: reset the time
-Up: add 30 seconds to time, add 5 minutes in case of long press
-Down: substract 30 seconds from time, substract 5 minutes in case of long press
-Start/Stop: start/stop counting
When time ends, it shows a blinking "FINISH" text and creates a beeping alarm.
